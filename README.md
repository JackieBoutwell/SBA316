# SBA316
This is my SBA for The Document Object Model.
The Virtual Farm lets you interactive with objects on the page.
Lets walk through it!

The first thing it asks the user is the number of animals on the farm.
To answer this you click on the rooster picture.This gives the user a prompt where you can input the answer. Once the rooser picture is clicked not only does it give you a prompt
but it also changes so that the rooster says Cock-a-Doodle-Doo!.
Moving on we have a fill in the blank section that asked the user to finish the word missing. give an error if not imputted correctly.
If inputted correctly does nothing but error goes away. If i had more time I would have loved to add a clear sign so the user knows they were right!
If you click on the pig picture it gives you an alert message so that it share a fun fact about pigs.
Below the picture of a pig you see a surprise button which changes the pig picture to something else!
And finally the the user is able to add more cows to the farm with a click of a button!

For this interactive webpage I used JavaScript and HTML.
I also used the Document Object Model (DOM) to querySelect, getElementsByID, fristChild, and InnerHTML. And many more.
Lastly, I used the Broswer Object Model(BOM) to display alerts and prompts for the user.
